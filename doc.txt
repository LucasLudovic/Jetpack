Abstract

    This document defines the Jetpack Protocol, an experimental communication
    protocol designed to support multiplayer gameplay in a 2D networked game
    inspired by the classic Jetpack title. The protocol specifies how clients
    communicate with the game server. It also describes the format used to
    transmit the game map data, including layout, entities, and relevant
    metadata necessary for consistent rendering and interaction across clients.

Status of This Memo

    This document describes the Jetpack Protocol developed as part of an
    academic project at Epitech. It has been drafted using the editorial
    guidelines set  forth in RFC 7322 to ensure clarity and consistency in its
    presentation.
    This memo is provided for experimental and informational purposes only and
    is not intended as an official standard. The specifications presented
    herein are subject to revision as the project progresses.

1. Introduction

    This document describes the Jetpack Protocol, which defines the
    communication between clients and the server, as well as the format for
    map data. Developed as part of an academic project at Epitech, this
    protocol aims to establish a clear and consistent structure for network
    interactions and map representation in a gaming environment.

2. Terminology

    In this document, the following terms are defined as follows:
        Client: Any application or device that connects to the server to
        send or receive data.
        Server: The central entity that handles client connections, processes
        requests, and manages the overall system state.
        Map: The data structure representing the game environment,
        including its layout, interactive elements, and associated metadata.
        Protocol: A set of rules and conventions outlining how clients and
        the server communicate, including the format of the exchanged data.

3. Protocol Description

    3.1 Client-Server Communication:
        This part outlines the procedures and rules governing how clients
        establish a connection with the server, exchange messages, and
        maintain a synchronized session. It will include the message
        formats, handshake process, error handling, and timing considerations.

    --> is Server to Client
    <-- is Client to Server


    (Connection State)
    --> WAITING_PLAYERS : You are connected but we still need to wait for other
    players

    (Init state)
    --> SEND_MAP: All players are connected, about to send the map
    --> "-----C----xxx\n"
        "----CC-------\n\r\n": map with this format
    --> "MAP_SENT": map sent, about to start the game
    <-- READY: when the player is ready to start the game
    --> GAME_START: when all player are ready and thus beginning the game

    (Game State) The client command can be send in any order and the response
    will always be the pos + score
    <-- PRESSED: When the player press the touch to use the jetpack
    <-- GETPOS: When the player doesn't press the touch to use the jetpack
    --> "$(xPos):$(yPos):$(yPos2):$(scoreP1):$(scoreP2)": pos and score, 1 or
    none is for p1 and 2 for p2
    --> WIN: When the game is over to tell if a player won
    --> LOSE: When the game is over to tell if a player losed
    --> DRAW: When the game is over to tell the player it's a draw


    3.2 Map Data Format:
    This section describes the structure used to represent the game map.
    It covers the layout, placement of interactive elements, and any
    metadata necessary to ensure that the map is correctly rendered and
    interpreted by both clients and the server.

    Map Layout:

    The map must be composed of 10 lines, each containing exactly the same
    number of characters and at most 10 000 characters.The characters used in
    the map are as follows:

    c: Represents a coin.
    e: Represents a laser.
    _: Represents empty space but any character other than c and e can be used.

    Map Representation

    Below is the map representation with each line containing 75 characters:

    ___________________________e________________________________________________
    ___________________________e______cccccc____________________________________
    ___________________________e_____ccccccc________________________eeeeeeeeeeee
    ___________________________e____cc__________________________________________
    ___________________________e___cc______e_________________________cccc_______
    ______________________________cc_______e_________________________cccc_______
    ________________________ccccccc________e____________________________________
    ________________________cccccc_________e_________________eeeeeeeeeeeee______
    _______________________________________e____________________________________
    _______________________________________e____________________________________
    
    This structured format ensures that the map is correctly interpreted by both
    the client and server, facilitating accurate rendering and interaction
    within the game.

4. Security Considerations

    As the Jetpack Protocol is designed for use in a controlled academic
    or experimental environment, security has not been a primary focus in
    its initial development. However, several potential security issues
    should be considered if the protocol were to be used in a broader
    or public context:

    Authentication:
        The current protocol does not implement any form of client
        authentication. This means that any user can connect to the
        server without verification, which could lead to unauthorized
        access or abuse.

    Data Integrity:
        Messages exchanged between the client and server are not protected
        against tampering. Without checksums, signatures, or encryption,
        malicious actors could potentially alter data in transit.

    Denial of Service (DoS):
        The protocol does not include mechanisms to detect or mitigate excessive
        or malicious traffic. A large number of connection attempts or malformed
        messages could overwhelm the server.

    Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks:
        Because communication is not encrypted, an attacker intercepting the
        traffic could read or modify messages exchanged between clients and the
        server.
